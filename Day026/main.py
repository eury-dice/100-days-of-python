# # List Comprehension
#
# # Exercise 1 - Square the original list
# numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# # ğŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above ğŸ‘†
#
# # Write your 1 line code ğŸ‘‡ below:
# squared_numbers = [(n ** 2) for n in numbers]
# # Write your code ğŸ‘† above:
#
# print(squared_numbers)
#
# # Exercise 2 - Make a list containing only even numbers
# numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# # ğŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above
#
# # Write your 1 line code ğŸ‘‡ below:
# result = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
# # Write your code ğŸ‘† above:
#
# print(result)
#
# # Exercise 3 - Output a list with integers that match
#
# # Using multiple lines
# with open("file1.txt") as file1:
#     data1 = file1.readlines()
# with open("file2.txt") as file2:
#     data2 = file2.readlines()
#
# result = [int(n) for n in data1 if n in data2]
#
# # As a single line
# # result = [int(line) for line in open("file1.txt").readlines() if line in open("file2.txt")]
#
# print(result)
#
# # Dictionary Comprehension
#
# # Exercise 4 - Make each word of the sentence as a key, with its length as the value
